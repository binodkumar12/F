## Understanding "Tina" in Chinese

There isn't a single, direct translation of "Tina" into Chinese since it's a Western name. Instead, Chinese speakers usually transliterate the name, choosing characters based on their pronunciation and desired meaning. Two common transliterations are:

*   **蒂娜 (Dì nà):** 蒂 (dì) often refers to the stem or calyx of a flower, implying beauty. 娜 (nà) signifies grace and elegance. This is a popular and aesthetically pleasing choice.

*   **婷娜 (Tíng nà):** 婷 (tíng) describes a beautiful and graceful woman. 娜 (nà) retains its meaning of grace and elegance. This is another common and favored transliteration.

The course will guide you through the proper stroke order and techniques to beautifully write both these variations of "Tina."
